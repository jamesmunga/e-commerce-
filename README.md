Abstract:
Objective:

The e-commerce will primarily provide a platform to purchase, sell, distribution of items, product or service through the internet and on some other network.  It will provide an option to a customer for the comparison of product with another seller, while a shop is available only at day time the e-commerce is available 24 hours of a day and seven days of the week. The e-commerce will be a huge marketplace as most of the business are going to implement based on the internet. This system will provide the detailed description of the products to users so that they can compare to the different product and will by the one which is more suitable to them. 
The problem with the e-commerce system:
The e-commerce system has various flaws in it as because of which most of the people donâ€™t use the system even though it has several advantages over traditional stores. The biggest problem is that it takes at least a day to deliver a product to the customer. While some other issues are a duplication of the product means the product is shown on the web some time differs with the original product due to which next time that customer go to buy the product through the traditional type of store.
Proposed system:

The e-commerce platform has many advantages, compare to traditional store as one can compare the cost of a product with other e-commerce websites, and if a user dislikes any product he/she can return it. While we can make use of the current technology to overcome the problem with the existing system. The e-commerce companies can use a flying robot, so when a user places an order, the company will send the product through the robot. The robot will find the user by using the GPS, and in this way, we can reduce the time to deliver a product. While before sending a product the e-commerce company will check the product that it is same or not with the requested order.
